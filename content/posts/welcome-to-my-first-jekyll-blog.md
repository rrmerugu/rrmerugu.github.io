Blogging isn't my thing, and I never imagined setting up a blog using Jekyll. Recently starting the new blog with Jekyll and loving it .

I could be able to setup this blog in 4 hours :D Just amazing. I wasted an hour  in these 4 hrs just because I didn't realize that changes in `_config.yml` will be not reload automatically like the way it happens for `scss, css, html, md` files. My bad I'm expecting the changed to reflect without restarting the Jekyll server. But anyways here we go, finally I'm able create a Jekyll blog starting from creating `jekyll new myblog` to customising(the current state of my blog ) in just 4 hours. How cool is that :D.

The best things about Jekyll:

  - **Loads really fast** - no server side rendering anyways
  - **secure** - no server side calculations or executions
  - **no database** - no mysql, username, password, administrations etc   
  - **markdown** - much better way of writing
