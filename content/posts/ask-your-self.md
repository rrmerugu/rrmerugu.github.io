On a good Monday start, I was browsing through the Linkedin posts and found a
blog by Richard Brandson of Virgin Group. It says

> Don't take yourself too seriously. Instead, ask yourself: is what I'm about to do going to make people smile? If the answer is yes, then do it! - Richard Brandson, Virgin Group.


He talks more about the lovely attitude and passion you should have to start something.
if it makes someone smile, then do it. As much as people want to build
something for Money or Fame, it's equally important for the the value you give
for the people.
