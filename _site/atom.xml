  &lt;p&gt;Product Feature Documentation keeps everyone in the team on the same page, so I decided to write product documentation the way a BA would do it !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--/excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/ba-0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Business Analyst&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of my personal startup-challenge to wear the hats of individual roles of a company in a day &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#onedaystartuprole&lt;/code&gt; . I founded my first company and launching a product Invaana with the all passion and dreams like any other entrepreneur. Then I was thinking about what if I hire people, and when they join the company, how would I make sure the new bees know what exactly I mean by product and what all it should do. So I decided the document the product, which I’ve never done before. So decided to behave like a Business Analyst(BA) for a day and write the product documentation ie., I should not Code(which I love so much) or do other marketing related stuff apart from being business analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, like any other internet enthusiast, I’ve started googling and reading few blogs. The best thing about being BA he should know everything to the minute fundamentals levels. The image below shows the precision level a BA tries to understand the scenarios. &lt;strong&gt;The more the questions BA ask himself or the Founders/team, the more he can create a good product use cases and stories&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-user-story-and-a-use-case-&quot;&gt;So what is user story and a use case ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User story&lt;/strong&gt; is a small description of something a user/actor wants to do to accomplish something. For Example: I want to login to change my password . User Stories are written from a single actor perspective with an action and a purpose. Let’s see the above example: I(Actor) want to login(action) to change my password(purpose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case&lt;/strong&gt; is a description of a set of interactions between a system and one or more actors. They are usually created as documents, and generally include this kind of information like use case title, rationale/description/ goal, actor/user, preconditions, standard paths or extensions, post conditions. Use case focusses more on the path of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To conclude, according to me, user stories focus on the action and result, but use cases focus more on the path of achieving an action and how system responds to the actor(ie., interaction between actor and system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m not sure If I’m on write track in writing this documentation, but this is much better than having nothing in my hand to show to future employees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being a Django developer, I strongly advocate KISS principle — Keep It Simple Stupid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/ba-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Business-Analyst&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I tried to make the documentation as light as possible so that future developers need not spends hours of time on reading to understand the product. The documentation simply shoes the basic info — actor, the action and the final result.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being the founder. I started to work on everything by self, while my hunt for cofounder and employees is still going on. It’s tough to do Multi-tasking, you will end up doing
lot things with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sometimes poor&lt;/code&gt; quality. So I decided to take one role a day.
&lt;!--/excerpt--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other early stage startup, I started to work on everything that range from thinking the product future, coding the product, taking feedbacks and many more, that range from talking to people as marketing strategy etc. Then I realized I’m not sure If I really can work on everything on a single. Multi-tasking is not really my thing. So then I made a decision to work on different things in different days, But being a startup i don’t have that luxury :( .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, planned to take some challenges &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#startuponedayrole&lt;/code&gt;, According to this challenge, in a day, my primary role is be something ie., Developer, Business Analyst, Testing Automation Developer, Tester. Primary role as in most of my day involves this role and I cannot make any excuses in finishing this role task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of the challenge, I need take the following challenges :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business Analyst day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tester &amp;amp; QA Day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business Development &amp;amp; Marketing Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite suite if I take all roles in a week, but I certainly most of them in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Story </title>

  &lt;p&gt;If you are a theist, you think its the beauty of God, But If you are a Scientist, you think, let’s explore why its beautiful. I prefer to be the second type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a stupidly curious guy with crazy imaginations. But I’m not into everything!, I don’t care about most of the things. Honestly as bad as it sounds, I don’t even know the current President of my country. The last one I knew was Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. The only reason I knew of him was because he is a Scientist and my academics back then had a subject General Knowledge in curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--/excerpt--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m not crazy my reality is just different from yours. — Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with what kind of Guy I am (from my perspective)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I live in my own world of Coding, Exploring the stuff that interests me. I’m too emotional about what I love, but I don’t essentially show that every time. I love Nature — Forests, Mountains and Water bodies. I love meeting new people, but unfortunately once they are out of sight, they are out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets start from the beginning, the very beginning — My Dreams as a Child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/my-story/baby.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;MegaMing baby picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to become a Scientist. I love the look of the Scientists in long white Aprons, with gloves, test tubes, glasses on they nose. I always wanted to become a Scientist with a thought that I can create whatever I want to If I become a scientist. Example: I was always curious about how we live, whats wrong with Oxygen, Carbondioxide, Why humans live on O2 but Trees live on CO2. What makes humans move and why trees can’t move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;school-and-college-confused-me-a-lot&quot;&gt;School and College Confused me a lot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/my-story/schoolboy.png&quot; alt=&quot;School kid picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;School in fact, confused me a lot with the little things I was taught&lt;/em&gt;. I thought If I could become a Scientist I could solve the mysteries in my head. In college, I studied Genetics just for this, then I did a course on Chemoinformatics, which completely changed my way from genetics. &lt;em&gt;I took Masters in Bioinformatics, because of the love for both computers and biology&lt;/em&gt;. I almost spent 2 years in doing academic research on Computational Drug Designing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;computational-drug-discovery-was-fascinating&quot;&gt;Computational Drug Discovery was fascinating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/my-story/cadd.png&quot; alt=&quot;CADD Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the years of my research career in Computational Drug Discovery, I’m so attached to the computers, because all the simulations need to be done on Linux machines sometimes HPCs :) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then worked as technical associate, later moved into programming and finally settled as a Developer as profession. But I still feel the thirst for scientific knowledge, reasoning and discovery. I wish I could restart my scientific research career soon or later. I’m actually planning something on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;being-developer-is-awesome&quot;&gt;Being Developer is awesome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/my-story/editor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Code Editor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being developer and being scientists are almost same, but if you are a scientist, you create something for the world, and if you are a developer, you create something for the fun ;) But, honestly both improve the life of Human Race in their own perspectives ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best part being a Coder is you can create anything you want to. PS: Atleast that’s what you feel ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I’m working on my first startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://invaana.com&quot;&gt;Invaana&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see what life has planned for me or what I’ll make out of my life ;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taking and winning challenges always inspire you and refills yours confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since college, I’ve always wanted to create something awesome, build something big. I know that sounds like any other crazy adolescent dreams, but yeah it’s kind of!. To be honest, I’ve always wanted to become a worlds renowned Scientist. But finally I founded my first startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--/excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after few years of academic research, working as technical associate in a computational drug discovery company, IT consultant for a Bay area startup, Software developer in IIT Delhi and Head of Technology and Development for a Food tech startup. I finally choose to start my own company. I gave a lot of thought, went through many names, and finalized a name &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Invana&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which is derivative of the words, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Invention&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nirvana&lt;/code&gt;. I’m so glad that sounds more Sanskritish than I always wanted :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I left the last company(March 31st 2016), and started working on building the product. The challenge is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I should not trim my beard till I achieve my first milestone&lt;/code&gt; which is getting at least 10,000 scientists and developers on to the platform. I know 10K users sounds less, but I believe getting 10K uses on board is just a beginning, not the end.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hello World! Welcome to my First Jekyll Blog!</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/welcome-to-my-first-jekyll-blog/"/>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/welcome-to-my-first-jekyll-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blogging isn’t my thing, and I never imagined setting up a blog using Jekyll. Recently starting the new blog with Jekyll and loving it .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--/excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be able to setup this blog in 4 hours :D Just amazing. I wasted an hour  in these 4 hrs just because I didn’t realize that changes in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; will be not reload automatically like the way it happens for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scss, css, html, md&lt;/code&gt; files. My bad I’m expecting the changed to reflect without restarting the Jekyll server. But anyways here we go, finally I’m able create a Jekyll blog starting from creating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new myblog&lt;/code&gt; to customising(the current state of my blog ) in just 4 hours. How cool is that :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best things about Jekyll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loads really fast&lt;/strong&gt; - no server side rendering anyways&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secure&lt;/strong&gt; - no server side calculations or executions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no database&lt;/strong&gt; - no mysql, username, password, administrations etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;markdown&lt;/strong&gt; - much better way of writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
