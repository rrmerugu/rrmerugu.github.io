title: Django Fake data
---


`django-autofixture`(https://github.com/gregmuellegger/django-autofixture) inserts the fake data into the 
models with no scripting . It gets the data up and running in single command `python manage.py loadtestdata blog.BlogPost:100`. 

I wish the fake data is in good english, but it's a good start.
