title: About me
---

> I'm a biologist who fell in love with Computers and the crazy things that can
be done with programming.

I worked as a technical associate in the field of Computer Aided Drug Discovery,
as a consultant s/w developer for a Bay area startup, as Product Engineer & Head
of Development in a Food Tech startup. Also developed few automation tools with
web interface for few tools in Computational Drug Discovery.

I'm a full stack web Engineer, who loves exploring and assembling the web components
into the way, that excites me ;)  

I'm passionate about coding web tech. I spend most of my time with/in
`Python`, `Django`, `Automation`, `Cognitive Computing`, `Cognitive Intelligence`.

If you think, we have something in common. Let me know!
